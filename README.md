Inspirational poem via Bing AI

> A reliquary with power untold,
> A treasure chest of stories old,
> A vessel of secrets, a box of gold,
> A thing of beauty to behold.
>
> It holds the key to ancient lore,
> The secrets of the gods of yore,
> The power to open any door,
> And so much more.
>
> It's said that those who hold it tight,
> Will have the power to make things right,
> To vanquish darkness with their might,
> And bring forth a new light.
>
> But beware, for power corrupts,
> And those who seek it will be struck
> By the curse that comes with such luck,
> And they will be forever stuck.
>
> So if you seek this powerful thing,
> Be careful what you wish to bring,
> For it may be more than just a fling,
> And you may end up with a sting.
